    "description": "Magaliessig offers established family homes and secure apartments at 20-30% lower prices than comparable Bryanston properties, making it highly attractive to young professionals and mid-career families seeking maximum living space. Strong rental yields (10-12%) and steady price appreciation position the suburb as an accessible entry point within the Sandton ecosystem.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Magaliessig is the savvy buyer's Bryanston—same schools, same security, 25% less money. Families escaping the Bryanston premium find 1,500-2,500sqm stands here for R2.85M instead of R3.5M. Investors love the 10-12% rental yields that outpace the leafy neighbor. Sparrow View apartments attract young professionals who'd rather own than rent, while renovation-ready homes in the residential stands create generational wealth for buyers willing to swing a paintbrush.",
