    "description": "Illovo remains highly attractive to young professionals and investors, with sectional title properties commanding 70%+ of the market. Despite price pressure and typical negotiation discounts of 8-12% from asking price, the suburb's proximity to Sandton and vibrant mixed-use precinct sustains strong fundamentals.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Illovo is Sandton's apartment capital—82% sectional title, 49% young professionals. Wanderers Club access and Thrupps café culture attract executives who work the 10-minute commute to their CBD offices. Freehold remains for the R8-10M crowd escaping Sandhurst's R18-25M median. Office-to-residential conversions like Illovo Central bring trendy lofts at R2.5-4M for design-conscious buyers. Sellers: backup power isn't optional anymore—it's the dealbreaker that separates 6-week sales from 6-month listings.",
