    "description": "Marlboro Gardens is a mixed-use suburb experiencing moderate downward price pressure (-4% YoY), making it attractive for value investors and first-time buyers. Strong rental yield potential (10-14% gross) and Gautrain proximity support income-focused purchasing, though security concerns around the N3 offramp require factoring into pricing.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Marlboro Gardens is the contrarian's play—-4% YoY decline means negotiating room, not doom. At R1.49M average and 10-14% rental yields, the math works for investors who see past the N3 noise. Bramley commands 38% more for similar returns. Flatlets generate dual income streams; the Gautrain station creates reliable tenant demand. It's a buyer's market with 100+ day cycles—advantage: those with cash and patience. Not for the prestige-conscious; perfect for the profit-focused.",
