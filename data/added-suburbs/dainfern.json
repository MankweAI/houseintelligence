    "description": "Dainfern remains a sought-after premium residential estate with established demand from families, expats, and investors seeking secure, golf-centric living. The market demonstrates resilience with steady price appreciation and consistent rental demand driven by corporate leases and quality-of-life amenities.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Dainfern is where the expat dollar lands. Corporate tenants pay R35-48K/month for fairway views and Gary Player course access—yields that make investors salivate. Families fleeing Bryanston's R4.3M+ averages find identical lifestyle here at R3.1M, 20% cheaper with better golf. The 1,235-home estate is built out; scarcity maintains pricing power. Premium villages command R7.5-13M while Dainfern Ridge offers the security without the golf premium at R2.6-4M. It's the only suburb where your neighbor might be a CEO on a 3-year Joburg posting.",
