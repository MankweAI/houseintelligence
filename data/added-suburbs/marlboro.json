    "description": "Marlboro is experiencing renewed buyer interest driven by first-time buyers and young professionals seeking affordable entry into Sandton's northern corridor. The suburb offers large stands and direct Gautrain access, though asking prices continue to exceed selling prices by ~R735,000, indicating persistent room for negotiation.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Marlboro is Sandton's gateway drug—R1.27M average versus Morningside's R4.2M for the same Sandton address. 36 sales in 2025 marked the best transaction volume in years. The Gautrain secret: 5 minutes to Sandton CBD, 15 to OR Tambo, direct to Pretoria. First-time buyers (40%) find 1,000-1,200sqm stands here with room for granny flats. The R735K gap between asking and selling prices? That's 12-15% negotiation for buyers who do homework. Semigrators returning from Cape Town are discovering what locals always knew.",
