    "description": "Wierda Valley has undergone significant transformation from residential to commercial and mixed-use development. Limited residential stock now available as office parks and retail dominate. Buyer interest remains strong for modern apartments due to CBD proximity and security, but supply constraints are pushing sellers' favour in available properties.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Wierda Valley is Sandton's vanishing residential frontier. As office parks devour the landscape, the few modern apartments left command seller advantage and corporate premium. Walk 5 minutes to Gautrain, 3 minutes to the CBD—commuters pay handsomely for that. Only 18 listings compete for corporate professionals who value MIELE kitchens and backup power over garden space. This isn't the suburb for families; it's for executives who work where they live and demand fortress-level security.",
