    "description": "Beverley offers exceptional value compared to adjacent Sandton suburbs, combining modern lifestyle estates with strong security infrastructure and proximity to the Sandton CBD. The market is driven by young professionals and established families seeking better price-to-quality ratios without sacrificing safety or convenience.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Beverley is Lonehill's better-value twin—8-12% cheaper for the same security infrastructure and family schools. The Stables and Soho Lofts complexes attract young professionals at R1.2-1.35M, while Tanglewood and Castello estates command R4-5.5M for those who've made it. Load shedding resilience now makes or breaks listings; solar-equipped homes see 50-65 day sales versus 90+ for grid-dependent dinosaurs. At 10km from Sandton CBD, Beverley proves you don't need a Sandton postcode to live a Sandton lifestyle.",
