    "description": "Buccleuch remains Gauteng's most accessible entry point to northern Johannesburg, dominated by sectional titles in strong rental demand. A buyers' market with modest growth, but solid fundamentals: institutional investment, family-friendly infrastructure, and rental yields of 12-14% keep investor interest steady despite price stagnation.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Buccleuch is Sandton's back door—half the price, double the yield. At R1.12M for an apartment and 12-14% gross returns, investors queue while first-time buyers celebrate escaping rent. Highway noise? The M1 is why commutes take 15 minutes, not 45. The buyer's market means 6-10% negotiation room for those who ask. Modderfontein Nature Reserve trails soften the urban edge. It's not glamorous—it's profitable. And in 2026's economy, profitable wins.",
