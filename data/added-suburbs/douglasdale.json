    "description": "Douglasdale is experiencing steady demand from first-time buyers and young professionals seeking affordability within reach of Sandton's CBD, with a balanced supply-demand dynamic favoring well-priced properties. Lifestyle estates and secure lock-up-and-go apartments continue attracting investors seeking rental yields and families valuing convenience over prestige.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Douglasdale defies Sandton's premium reputation—here, young professionals outnumber wealthy retirees 3-to-1. The secret? Lock-up-and-go security at prices 30% below Fourways, just 13km from high-paying CBD jobs. Sectional titles under R1.05M fly off the market in 6 weeks, while investors chase gross yields of 8-10%. Sellers staging for the Instagram generation—not retired executives—are winning the listing wars.",
