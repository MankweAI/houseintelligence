    "description": "Wendywood maintains its position as Sandton's most accessible middle-tier suburb, attracting families and investors seeking security and value. Rising rental yields (10-13% gross) and sustained sectional title demand underpin steady market momentum despite broader market cautiousness.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Wendywood is where Sandton becomes affordable. At R2.5M average—with 6.3% growth—it outperforms premium neighbors on value metrics. The Foundry's R1.45-1.5M apartments command R13K+ monthly rents within 6-8 week sales cycles. Esprit Estate gives families 109 freestanding options between R2.5-3.5M with actual community. Gautrain Marlboro station is 10 minutes away; CBD is the same. Investors chase 10-13% yields while owner-occupiers find tree-lined boomed streets identical to Gallo Manor at 12% less.",
