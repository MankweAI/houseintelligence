    "description": "Edenburg blends commercial vibrancy with residential convenience, attracting young professionals and buy-to-let investors. Market leans buyer-favorable with oversupply of sectional titles, though well-priced apartments under R1.5M sell within 8-12 weeks.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Edenburg is where Sandton's workers actually live. First-time buyers dominate (47% of transactions) because a R1.29M apartment here puts them 5 minutes from the CBD, not 20. Investors salivate at 11-16% gross yields—nearly double premium Sandton. The catch? It's a buyer's market with room to negotiate 7-10% below asking. Smart sellers highlight Gautrain bus access and solar systems; those who don't price for the corporate commuter crowd watch listings linger.",
