    "description": "Gallo Manor maintains robust buyer demand driven by affordable pricing within Sandton, excellent security infrastructure, and spacious family-sized properties on generous stands. Market activity remains strong with 73 sales in 2025 and average prices appreciating 11%+ year-on-year, signaling healthy investor and end-user confidence.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Gallo Manor is Sandton's best-kept secret—11.4% price growth while neighbors stagnate. Buyers find 1,500sqm family stands for R2-3M less than Wendywood or Morningside, identical boomed security included. The Tugela Crescent enclosure commands an 8-12% premium because HOA governance actually works. Morning Glen Mall proximity creates 10-12% rental yields for savvy investors. Extension 2 is where renovators build generational wealth, and the Reddit threads calling it a 'hidden gem' are finally getting attention.",
