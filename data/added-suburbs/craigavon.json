    "description": "Craigavon sits at the intersection of established residential appeal and emerging commercial opportunity, with strong demand from first-time buyers and young professionals seeking security and convenience. Market conditions favor well-priced properties; selective sellers can command premiums for modern renovations, backup power, and boomed estate locations.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Craigavon is Fourways without the price tag—45% of buyers are first-timers who do the math: R715K entry vs Fourways' R1.65M. Solar panels add 8-12% to asking price here because load shedding broke this market's patience. Springwood Estate's new 64-unit development at R2.4-2.9M proves appetite exists for modern family living. At 20-30% below Fourways, the value proposition is arithmetically irresistible for anyone willing to trade prestige for practicality.",
