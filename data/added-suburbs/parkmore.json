    "description": "Parkmore is experiencing steady demand as families and investors seek mid-to-premium homes with strong security and proximity to Sandton CBD at a 25-40% discount to neighboring premium suburbs. Rate cuts and a buyer's market are slowing velocity, creating negotiation opportunities for well-positioned properties.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Parkmore is Bryanston at a 23% discount. The same boomed streets, 3-minute armed response, and school catchments—just without the prestige tax. Families upgrading from sectional titles find 900-1,500sqm stands for R4.4M versus Bryanston's R5.5-6.5M. The Marina Vista and Parkmore Place complexes feed investor appetite at 10%+ yields. Parkmore Road noise? A 5-10% discount for exposure—but buyers get Sandton City in 5 minutes flat. It's the suburb where 8-12% negotiation room meets PCA security standards.",
