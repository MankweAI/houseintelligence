    "description": "Broadacres continues to attract first-time buyers and young professionals seeking affordability and security in the Fourways node. High sectional title demand and strong rental yields (8-10% gross) position it as a solid buy-to-let market, though Cedar Road traffic remains a pricing constraint.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Broadacres rewards the patient investor. At R1.22M sectional average, it's 15% below Fourways proper—but yields 8-10% gross versus their 7-8%. First-time buyers (38% of transactions) escape the rental trap here. Cedar Lakes Estate offers resort living at R4.5-9M for those who've graduated from apartments. The Cedar Road noise? A 5-8% discount for exposed units—a price some gladly pay for a 5-minute commute to Fourways Mall and Life Hospital.",
