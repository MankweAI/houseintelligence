    "description": "Kramerville operates primarily as a premium design and creative district with minimal residential inventory. Residential properties are scarce and rarely listed, making the market highly specialized and driven more by commercial-to-residential conversions than traditional housing.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Kramerville doesn't sell homes—it sells opportunities. With only 1-2 residential listings at any given time, this is Sandton's design district, not a family suburb. @Home, Coricraft, and Weylandts make it South Africa's furniture capital; developers pay R23M+ for conversion potential. The few apartments that exist command R5.9M because location means walking to work in the creative industry. Don't look here for schools or parks—look here if you're buying a business address that doubles as a bed.",
