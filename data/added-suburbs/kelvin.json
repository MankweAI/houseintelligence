    "description": "Kelvin offers established family living with 654 freehold properties and modern sectional title options, positioned ideally between Sandton CBD and Midrand. Strong appeal to upgrading families and buy-to-let investors seeking value with infrastructure convenience.",
    "narrativeSummary": "Kelvin is where the Gautrain becomes a lifestyle. A 4-minute walk to Marlboro station shaves 30 minutes off daily commutes and adds R50-100K to property values. Upgrading families find 1,800-2,700sqm stands at R2.3M—70% cheaper than Morningside for the same Sandton address. The catch: 105-day marketing cycles mean patience pays. Solar panels and backup power aren't luxuries here; they're the new baseline for buyers who've endured load shedding.",
